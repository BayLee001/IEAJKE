# IEAJKE
Codes and data for our paper "[Iterative Entity Alignment via Joint Knowledge Embeddings](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0595.pdf)"

Codes will come soon. 

## dataset
All datasets are now availabled in data folder. For DFB-1, DFB-2 and DFB-3, we provide four files
* common_entities.txt: alignment seeds;
* entity2id.txt: the correspondence of entities and their ids;
* relation2id.txt: the correspondence of relations and their ids;
* triple2id.txt: all triples in FB15K. Note that this is not the original form, but a processed one where entity seeds are already combined as one.

For DFB-4, we provide common_entities.txt. You could use the original FB15K as your dataset.
